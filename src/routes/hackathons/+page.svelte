          A hackathon is a large weekend event where students gather (usually in teams of 1â€“4) to build and develop programming projects. Since there is generally a time limit anywhere from 24 to 48 hours, there's often lots of caffeine involved.

          Below are listed all the hackathons I've attended in reverse chronological order.
