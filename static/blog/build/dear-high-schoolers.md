![piles of boxes labeled Pre-AP strewn across a computer lab](pre_ap_cesspool.avif "Thousands of Pre-AP booklets staged for sorting in my old high school library. Possibly the saddest photograph I have ever captured.")

I'm a second-year undergrad at the Colorado School of Mines, and I haven't
thought about my SAT score for ages. In fact, I've forgotten what it was. I
also couldn't tell you how many AP classes I took, or how many 5s I earned from
them.

In 11th or 12th grade—I can't remember which—I found myself sitting in an
unfamiliar high school with truly impressive cascades of mucus emanating from
my nostrils. This circumstance was especially awkward because I was in a room
full of other students taking the SAT. I'd already taken it, but I was trying
again because I was unsatisfied with my previous score. Unsure how to
discreetly extract the snot with an already-soaked tissue, I attempted to use
the tissue as a glove while pinching the albumen-like liquid and pulling away
from my face. This was comically ineffective. A proctor noticed and offered me
more tissues.

Gross, right? But not nearly as disgusting as the inane grindset imposed on
high school students by corporate entities like the College Board and
reinforced by society's obsessive veneration for the top 1% of postsecondary
education institutions. Many of my classmates spent their high school years
overemphasizing the idea of getting into a "good college." Anything less than
an A was a calamity. Some extracurriculars were taken up for enjoyment; others
were chosen to lengthen the lists in our Common App accounts. On Reddit, we
could find more extreme versions of ourselves jokingly offering to exchange
their firstborn children for 5s on their AP exams. *Our main focus should be
acceptance into an elite university,* we subconsciously assured ourselves.
*After that, our path to wealth and happiness is secured.*

A person's wealth and success stem from their attitude, the ideals they pursue,
and unfortunately, other factors outside their control. However, those factors
are mostly independent of which university they attend. Life is not measured by
test scores, grades, or some other numerical proxy for worthiness, but rather
guided by intangibles like discovering what brings you fulfillment, making
friends, practicing skills you'll need for your career, and enjoying
opportunities that won't come again. High school develops those intangibles.
Allowing college worries to overshadow them oversimplifies the purpose of high
school.

The misunderstanding of purpose extends to college, too. When in high school,
it's easy to become so focused on college applications that you forget why you
are pursuing postsecondary education in the first case. Most people, once they
understand their motivations clearly enough to articulate them, will find that
a lesser-known local school can meet their needs just as well as a prestigious
one. Both enable you to enter a field that requires a degree, to discover the
joy of spending four years with other young people, or simply to act on your
belief that education is intrinsically valuable. All these universal rewards
are more important than the university-specific ones.

Moreover, acceptance into an elite university does not guarantee wealth or
happiness. Rather, elite universities seem to be conducive to success because
they only accept students who would be successful anywhere. Although I
certainly wouldn't discourage anyone from dreaming of getting into Stanford, I
would discourage the idea of designing their high school career around that
objective.

Of course, some universities are undoubtedly better than others. Compared to me
at Mines, an undergraduate with the same major at MIT will enjoy a
much-improved networking profile which will probably lead to a higher-paying
job. They'll also have more research opportunities, sponsored by a larger
endowment. I admit that I'd be going to such a university now if I had been
accepted to one. But if these benefits require four years of sacrifice, you'll
have to carefully consider whether the tradeoff is justifiable.

There's also the issue of luck. Some factors of getting accepted to a
university are out of your control. In fact, all top-tier institutions see more
qualified applicants than they have room for. Wise people design their life so
that they don't have to be lucky to stay out of trouble. That's why they save
for emergency funds and wear seat belts. You, too, can diminish the need for
luck in your college career by admitting you can be happy and accomplished at
schools that aren't your first choice.

This doesn't mean things like grades or the SAT are unimportant. I'm only
stressing that they instantly lose their importance the moment you submit your
enrollment deposit. In contrast, other high school pursuits cultivate personal
growth, an asset whose importance never fades.

So, if any overachieving high school students have happened upon this little
essay, I ask you to use your last pre-college years well. You'll never get to
be a high schooler again. You'll never get to be a non-adult again. Don't
burden yourself with relatively short-term concerns. Go do stuff. Make the most
of it.
