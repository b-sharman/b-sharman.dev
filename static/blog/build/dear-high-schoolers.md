I haven't thought about my SAT score for ages. In fact, I've forgotten what it
was. I also couldn't tell you how many AP classes I took, or how many 5s I
earned from them.

In 11th or 12th grade—I can't remember which—I found myself sitting in an
unfamiliar high school with truly impressive cascades of mucus emanating from
my nostrils. This circumstance was especially awkward because I was in a room
full of other students taking the SAT. I'd already taken it, but I was trying
again because "my old score wasn't good enough," or so I told my parents.
Unsure how to discretely extract the snot with an already-soaked tissue, I
attempted to use the tissue as a glove while pinching the albumen-like liquid
and pulling away from my face. This was comically ineffective. A proctor
noticed and offered me a box of tissues.

Gross, right? But not nearly as disgusting as the inane grindset imposed on
high school students by corporate entities like the College Board and
reinforced by society's obsessive veneration for the top 1% of postsecondary
education institutions. I spent most of high school designing my life around
the idea of getting into a "good college". I found like-minded people on
internet forums jokingly offering to exchange their firstborn child for 5s on
their AP exams. Anything less than an A was a calamity. Some extracurriculars
were taken up for enjoyment; others were chosen to augment the size of the list
in my Common App account. *My main focus should be acceptance into a good
college,* I thought. *After that, my path to wealth and happiness will be
secured.*

A few weeks after my nasal mucus SAT catastrophe, I got my score back. It was
lower than one I already had.

I think too many of us Mines students faced similar misdirection in high
school. Many of us aimed for schools like Stanford, Harvard, or MIT, then found
ourselves having to rethink our motive for going to college when we were forced
to attend our backup school. I live the very outcome I was trying to avoid when
I made myself retake the SAT while sick.

It only took a few days at Mines to reshape my priorities. Suddenly it became
very obvious that what makes you wealthy or successful is the kind of person
you are and the kinds of pursuits you engage in, and those things are mostly
independent of the college you go to. I stopped living in a simulation and
realized that in real life, quality of life is not measured by test scores,
grades, or some other numerical proxy for worthiness, but rather guided by
intangibles like discovering what brings you fulfillment, learning how to make
friends, pursuing the skills you'll need in your career, and enjoying
opportunities that might never come again.

High school is also full of opportunities. It's not often that you get to learn
how to drive for the first time, enjoy sports and recreation built in to your
school, or try myriad things that kids couldn't do, all behind the protection
of a parental safety blanket. It's a great time to try a sport, pick up a
hobby, or discover what activities rejuvenate you. There's so much to explore
at an age ideal for exploration.

This doesn't mean things like grades or the SAT are unimportant. I'm only
stressing that they instantly lose their importance the moment you submit your
enrollment deposit. In contrast, other high school activities cultivate
personal growth, an asset whose importance never fades.

So, if any overachieving high school seniors have happened upon this little
essay, I ask you to use your last year well. You'll never get to be a high
school student again. You'll never get to be a non-adult again. Don't burden
yourself with relatively short-term concerns. Go do stuff. Make the most of it.
