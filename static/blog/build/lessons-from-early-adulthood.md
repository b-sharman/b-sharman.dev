I've only been an adult for a couple years, and I've learned a lot since then.
I have a lot more left to learn, but cementing your existing lessons is part of
that process. In this post, I want to list a few things I've learned from high
school and college which are widely applicable to college students. Many of
them are probably applicable to pretty much everyone, but I've noticed that
undergrads, being adults for the first time, sometimes benefit from information
that might seem obvious to others.

**Go out and do stuff with people.** College is an ideal setting for this. Try
a sport, a club, or restaurant. Ask your friends if they want to hike South
Table this weekend. You'd be surprised how many of them were willing to get
together but waiting for someone else to initiate.

**Take meals, chores, and other responsibilities seriously.** It's tempting to
skip breakfast to buy yourself an extra hour of sleeping in, to allow the
floors to go unswept, to stay up so that bedtime doesn't cut leisure time
short. Stop treating these like valid options. You're an adult. You have to eat
breakfast. You have to clean the floor. You have to go to bed. These tasks
constitute critical maintenance for various aspects of your health. Anyone who
is unhealthy, by choice or by misfortune, can tell you that health is a gift.
Don't allow lack of self-control to squander it.

**Getting behind in classes is an emergency.** It's not something you "work on"
when you feel like it. If an assignment is past due, and especially if you
haven't gotten an extension, you need to treat it urgently, to cancel
everything except eating, sleeping, and classes until you get it done. If this
sounds like it will suck, that's because it does. That's why you shouldn't let
yourself get in this situation. As you get more and more behind, it becomes
exponentially harder to catch up.

**Write thank-you letters and stay in touch.** Writing is a powerful form of
communication, and receiving gifts is a great excuse to use it. Once you've
bought envelopes and stamps, it only takes 20 or 30 minutes of effort—or less,
if you write faster than I—to communicate to people how much you value them.
This will likely give you great satisfaction, as valuing other people is pretty
much the main point of existence. There are other ways to keep up, too.
Although instant messaging is the most convenient, a phone call only costs an
hour and yields a longer and more meaningful interchange.

**Escalate problems before they become big problems.** If you don't do anything
or say anything, things won't get better. Issues are much easier to address
when they're not pervasively incapacitating. Whether your roommate isn't doing
their dishes, your coworker has an annoying habit, or a professor's lecture
style isn't effective for you, passive endurance is sure to be an ineffective
counter. You have to do something about it.

All of these have a central theme: **reject passivity in favor of action.**
Doing nothing is naturally a default state, but everything in life that has
value comes from taking action (or from other people taking action). So take
action.

These aren't the only pieces of wisdom I have cultivated, but they're a good
place to start. I still have a very long way to go, but I'm grateful for the
opportunity to have learned these things so far. The acquisition of wisdom is
extremely important to me, so I'm excited to come across more lessons in the
future!
