Welcome to my website, a static site built on Svelte 5 and TailwindCSS v4. My
website does a lot of things, but they can all be simplified as using
Javascript to turn JSON, images, and Markdown into a static site made of HTML
and CSS. A good example is `static/blog/index.json`, whose data is used to
create the blog list on the main page, the blog elements on each blog page, the
"Recent Posts" section at the end of each blog page, and the RSS feed.
